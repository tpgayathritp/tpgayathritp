Hi, I'm Gayathri T. P  
Senior Software Engineer
Location: Queensland, Australia  

I’m a results‑driven Senior Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience in Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, Oracle Applications R12, and Application Support.  
Recently, I’ve expanded my skill set into Python, building practical tools that combine business logic, databases, and user‑friendly interfaces.

I enjoy solving real business problems, improving system performance, and delivering solutions that make life easier for end users and teams.

A complete desktop payroll application built using **Python, SQLite, Tkinter, PDF generation, and CSV reporting.

This project reflects my passion for building practical, real‑world automation tools.
